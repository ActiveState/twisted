twisted.web.http had several several defects in HTTP request parsing that could permit HTTP request smuggling. It now disallows signed Content-Length headers, forbids illegal characters in chunked extensions, forbids 0x prefix to chunk lengths, and only strips spaces and horizontal tab characters from header values. These changes address CVE-2022-24801 and GHSA-c2jg-hw38-jrqq.
