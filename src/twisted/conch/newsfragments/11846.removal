twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key support for loading "alternate" OpenSSH private keys is now deprecated.
These are some private keys that at some point were handled by OpenSSH but for which no specification exists.
For more info about these OpenSSH keys see https://github.com/twisted/twisted/issues/3008.
